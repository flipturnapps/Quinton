#Qork
###Overview
Quinton's Text Based Game

Notice: this project may look like a direct rip-off of Zork.
it is.

This project is dependent on kevinLibrary.  See the [KevinLibrary Repository](https://github.com/flipturnapps/FlipTurnApps-KevinLibrary.git) for download.

###XML
A  feature of this game is the world's save file's two-way fluidity with XML. The game is saved in XML but the data can be edited while the application is not running.

###Alpha
This branch is working towards finishing Alpha development by the end of the month! See you for the release then!
