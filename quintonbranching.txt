Helloz.

You will have noticed i deleted your branch.  Those changes have been moved to alphadev.

CommandRoom isn't actually a thing.  Rather, RoomCommand and its children, 
such as MirrorRoomCommand can use commands on a room by room basis. (you just need another subclass of RoomCommand)

To see these beautiful changes and dev your own fallow these steps.

Right click on Quinton [master] and switch to branch "other..."

Click on remote tracking and then on alphadev

Then checkout as local branch

Name it testworlddev or whatever
